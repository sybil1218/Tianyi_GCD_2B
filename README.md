**I think many people who are new to creative computing will feel a bit overwelming, learning creative computing like learning a new language, there are lots of new grammar and logic. But after a week of self-study, I found that learning programming is not as difficult as I imagined. If you let go of your fear and actually start the journey. More aptly, I realised that creative computing is not about how to write codes but how to use code. After understanding the basic logic of programming, and learning how to use open source. This vibrant creative community opens up many possibilities for my creative path.**
## p5.js
**[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! (This week, I learned p5.js, I think it is a good coding website for the beginners. I want to share how I learned basic programming language from it, and as a creative worker, how to use opensource to make what you want.)**

## How to start

**If you don't know anything about programming, you can try the get started tutorial first so you will get a basic understanding of those coding logic such as how to create a canvas, how to add functions and modify parameters. You will find that programming is like building a house, with a rough basement first, then, you can add, delete, and modify, play with details.**

## How to use open source to create what you want

**[Open Precessing](https://openprocessing.org/) is an open source community,You can find a lot of source code in it.**

## Try to modify a source code

**If you understand these codes, you will see that these data represent colors, pixel sizes, dimensions, movement, etc., now you can try to change these data, or try to add some new instrauctions.
I try to modify the source code of this camera filterÔºàhttps://openprocessing.org/sketch/1183406Ôºâ**

**I really like its deformation effect, but I think its pixel square is too big, so I changed its size and color by editing thecode so I can get my wanted effect.**

## Use referenceÔºÅ

**If you can't undestand a code, you can search for its functions and operating rules in the reference. At the same time, if you want to add or modify some functions and effects, you can also find it in the reference.**

**I hope my exploration process can bring some inspiration to you and help your creative process! In the learning process, it is common to get trapped by not understanding those coding languages and the logic behind it, so for the further learning, I want to understand more coding languages, because if I understand them, I can use them. üëãÔΩû**
